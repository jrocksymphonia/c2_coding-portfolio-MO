# Manuela's Coding Portfolio
Week 2 Challenge Focus: putting my Advanced CSS skills into practice!

## Description

This project is intended to show my understanding of building my first webpage from scratch using my knowledge of HTML and advanced CSS code. The webpage is a portfolio of all the coding work I have done so far as well as the projects I will be doing in the future to present to potential employers. 

The webpage is based off the original sketch I made here:

    ```md
    ![portfolio-sketch](./assets/images/portfolio_sketch.HEIC)
    ```
